Rob has started working on this Hylia site some time ago to provide content updates to his numerous readers. Zero is a number, so numerous being zero for now.

Hylia is a lightweight [Eleventy](https://11ty.io) starter kit with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) pre-configured, so that you can one-click install a progressive, accessible blog in minutes. It also gives you a well organised starting point to extend yourself.

Get started now by [deploying Hylia to Netlify.](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia&stack=cms)
